Hello Mario,
As discussed today, I'm passing this case to you to review the behavior identified by the customer:
New defect description
When exporting the BPMN diagrams selected, the files are saved into a new folder that is created using the parent process name e.g. PHX_BPMS044_BP_Approval.
If a folder with the parent process name already exists, a new folder is created using the parent process name with _1 appended to the end e.g. PHX_BPMS044_BP_Approval_01.
When both folders described above (PHX_BPMS044_BP_Approval, PHX_BPMS044_BP_Approval_1) already exist, expected behaviour is that a new folder named PHX_BPMS044_BP_Approval_2 would be created. This is not happening, the BPMN files are exported to folder PHX_BPMS044_BP_Approval_1 which overwrites the existing files in the folder.
Expected behaviour
When exporting the selected BPMN diagrams:
1.	Check if a folder with the parent process name exists.
2.	If exists, loop until folder name using format <parent_process_name>_<i> does not exist
Scenario 1
Existing folders
- PHX_BPMS044_BP_Approval
- PHX_BPMS044_BP_Approval_1
Outcome
On next export. folder PHX_BPMS044_BP_Approval_2 is created.
Scenario 2
Existing folders
- PHX_BPMS044_BP_Approval_1
- PHX_BPMS044_BP_Approval_2
Outcome
On next export. folder PHX_BPMS044_BP_Approval is created.
Scenario 3
Existing folders
- PHX_BPMS044_BP_Approval
- PHX_BPMS044_BP_Approval_2
Outcome
On next export. folder PHX_BPMS044_BP_Approval_01 is created.
Steps to reproduce issue:
1. I exported a process with children and picked a parent and a child to export	 
	- They are exported	 
	- The directory is created containing the files: "Model succesfully exported to the foler: 	C:\Users\JEspitia\Documents\PHX_BPMS044_BP_Approval\"
	- The files contain only the intended processes and nothing more.	
2. I repeat the test	 
	- They are exported.
	- The directory is created containing the files: "Model succesfully exported to the foler: 	C:\Users\JEspitia\Documents\PHX_BPMS044_BP_Approval_1\"
	Note that the filename has changed and is appended with _1	 
	- The new directory is created containing my files.	 
3. I repeat the test	 
	- The directory is created containing the files: "Model succesfully exported to the foler: 	C:\Users\JEspitia\Documents\PHX_BPMS044_BP_Approval_1\"
	- They are exported, but the filename remains at _1 - I would expect it to be _2 now.
